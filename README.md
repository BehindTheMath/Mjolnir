# Mjolnir
Mjolnir is a tool that attempts to crack the password to a Java keystore or key using a brute force algorithm, using multi-threading to optimize excution time.

This is a fork of Antony Lees' [Mjolnir project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mjolnir-utils/). He wrote an excellent [blog post](https://antonylees.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-i-brute-forced-my-own-keystore.html) explaining the rationale behind his algorithms and code.  
Since his project was not on Github, I was unable to fork it. However, I did clone it with git, and it is preserved in this repo, in the [`original`](/tree/original) branch.

## Changelog
The basic structure of the project is the same as Antony Lees' original Mjolnir project.  
I had originally planned on only adding a command line argument parser to make it more flexible. However, one thing led to another, and I ended up changing and adding a lot more.

##### v0.1.0
- Command line arguments instead of hard-coded values
- Gradle build system to simplify building and testing
- Ability to start in middle of a run
- Switched from Threads and Runnables to ExecutorService and Callables
- Added a BufferedInputStream to the KeystoreLoader (this increased performance by over 4x)
- Lots of unit tests

## Usage
1. Download the latest `mjolnir.jar` file from the [Releases](/releases) page.
2. Run the program using the following syntax: `java -jar mjolnir.jar options`.

#### Command Line Options
| Switch | Argument | Explanation |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| -s | ["keystore" \| "key"] | Determines which password is being brute forced: the keystore or a key inside the keystore. This argument must be first.
| -p | password | The password for the keystore. Required if you want to brute-force the password of a key.
| -k | keyname | The name of the key to brute-force.
| -f | filepath | The path to the keystore file. Can be relative to the working directory.
| -t | threads | The number of concurrent threads to use (default is 4).
| -n | numAttempts | Log the progress every numAttempts for each thread (default is 20000). Set to 0 to disable logging.
| -l | lastattempt | The last attempt already tried. The program will start after that attempt.
| -m | minGuessLength | The minimum guess length to attack.
| -x | minGuessLength | The maximum guess length to attempt (default is the same as minGuessLength).
| -c | characterSet | The set of possible characters to try.

##### Examples:
`java -jar mjolnir.jar -s keystore -f test_keystore.jks -t 4 -n 20000 -l taaa -m 4 -x 5 -c abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

`java -jar mjolnir.jar -s key -f test_keystore.jks -p test -k "test key" -t 4 -n 20000 -m 5 -c abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890`

## To do
- Instead of calculating the next guess on the fly when it's requested, use a separate thread to preload guesses into a BlockingDeque, and have the other threads pull guess from it.  
In my tests, this didn't result in a performance gain, but it might help prevent concurrency issues and race conditions.
- Instead of using the standard Keystore API to attempt loading the keystore, create a custom implementation that only does the necessary calculations to validate the attempted password. This should improve performabce by eliminating unnecessary calculations.
